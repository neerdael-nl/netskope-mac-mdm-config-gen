# Netskope MDM Script Generator (JAMF, Workspace ONE, Microsoft Intune) 

This project is a web application that generates custom configuration scripts for Netskope MDM deployment and support deployment on JAMF, Workspace One and Intune. It consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend, which work together to create a zip file containing customized installation scripts and configuration files. The easiest and recommended deployment option would be to just use the included docker-compose.yml file.

## Features

- Generate custom plist files for Netskope configuration
- Create pre-install and post-install scripts with user-provided parameters
- Package all necessary files into a downloadable zip archive
- Support for optional enrollment tokens for secure enrollment

## To-do

- Add support for Khandji
- Validate support for Workspace ONE and JAMF
- Add dropdown selection menu for MDM platform of choice
- Include installation instructions for MDM platform of choice in pre-packaged zip

## Prerequisites

- npm (v6 or later)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
